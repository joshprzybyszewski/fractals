## Old Solution

This solution in Java is from early 2014 when I hadn't even been writing code for a year. I've submitted it in all of its original glory, using Java swing, no "Clean Code" concepts, commented out lines, and all. Looking at it again, I remember that I had had the thought "what happens if there are slight mutations in the pattern?" So it seems I had implemented a way for each line to randomly be a few degrees off from 90 (by slightly changing the x,y coordinate the line would draw to). I don't remember being impressed by the result; it was just chaotic.
